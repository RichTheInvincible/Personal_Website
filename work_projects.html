        <blockquote>"Emergent Systems is a global engineering services and technology company serving the Automotive, Aerospace, Bio-Medical, Energy and Consumer Products industries since starting operations in 1999. Participating in developing products that are energy efficient is of particular interest to us. We are mindful of our footprint. We continually endeavor to be less wasteful, and more efficient in our processes and interactions. In turn, we help in the design, engineering and development of leaner products, products that are less wasteful and more efficient.
        Our uniqueness comes from our ability to perform new product development on products that straddle multiple domains. Hence our teams consist of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, industrial designers, analysts and artists.
        We are multi-CAD, multi-technology capable –  Catia, UG, ProE, Nastran, Ansys, and many others, our team members are capable of working with them all. We also offer comprehensive CAD technology and data migration services."

        "At Detroit Flying Cars, we are developing a uniquely more flexible form of transportation. Fly when you want, drive when you have to. Hundreds of miles of uninterrupted travel. And adventure! A more versatile form of personal mobility. Personal because it’s your environment wherever you go. No more planes, trains and automobiles! Start from your home or garage, drive out of your driveway and neighborhood, find the runway for your machine, push a button to stretch your wings, and fly hundreds of miles. If you don’t like the weather, land, push a button to transform this machine into an efficient road worthy electric car, and keep the journey going. A machine that sets us free!
        Detroit Flying Cars has been assisted in engineering the first prototype by Emergent Systems, an extraordinary design and engineering company based in Dearborn Michigan. Emergent Systems, with its most creative and inquisitive talent anywhere, has helped give shape and analytical substance to the design. A team of airplane enthusiast have helped keep the building momentum going. And there’s more to be done."
