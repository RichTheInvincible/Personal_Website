        <p>The dynamically updating results, takeaways, and findings from my years competing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._in_esports" target="_blank">Super Smash Brothers Melee (2001)</a>. In late 2015, I was in undergrad at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. One of the things I was interested in from my classes at the College of Business, was using Excel for statistics and data collection. So, when I entered my first tournament, I decided I would start collecting data about my matches with no real goal in mind other than being able to mess around with Excel. This page contains some of my anecdotal results, takeaways, and findings. Many of the graphs and charts you see on this page are dynamic and will change as the data is updated, and many of the things I write will be generalizations about the data so I won't have to keep updating this. I'm also going to try and keep my explanations short, and only include the things I find interesting, as I could break this down month-by-month or year-by-year for each section.

        <p>I am part of a small team that organizes a larger panel of about 15 people (which I am also in), tasked to evaluate the tournament results of all the players in Michigan to come up with an official state-wide ranking.
        The ranking serves to acknowledge the hard work of players in-region and also tell other regions which Michigan players are strong at national events.  I have been on the core organizing panel and on the larger voting panel since early 2018.
        Here is a couple examples of recent rankings we released:

        </br>
        </br>
        <p>You may have heard that having a 5–12 seed upset is a staple of filling out your tournament bracket. As it is, the 12 seed has upset the 5 seed ~35% of the time historically, making it likely for at least one upset to happen every year. Fans have fun speculating which 5 seed will fall to a 12 seed every time the bracket gets released. The matchup that gets overlooked as a result, is the 6–11 matchup...
