        <span class="papers">Active Measurements of Routes, Losses, and Delays (tracert)</span>
        </br>
        </br>
        <p>In this paper I analyze the connection between my local machine to the network locations of five different websites across the globe. I trace the route from my machine to the remote locations as well as measure packet loss and round-trip time ten times over the span of a week. I trace the route and measure packet loss and round-trip time for the following five websites: www.microsoft.com, www.ford.com, www.dhs.gov, www.ox.as.uk, www.momat.go.jp.

        <span class="papers">Head to Head Database Web Application </span>
        </br>
        </br>
        <p>In this project, I make a web application to access Head to Head match data from a database. The web application lets you search a player's name in a searchable dropdown and then displays the players' head to head record with another player, what tournament(s) they played at, the matchup winner and loser at that tournament, and the date of the tournament.  I'm not hosting this database web application anywhere but there are screenshots in the document if you are interested.

        </br>
        </br>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to set up a local WCF service using Internet Information Service(IIS), which used simple calculation methods and set up a Client web form that communicated with the service to execute the method calculations.

        </br>
        </br>
        <p>I made an Excel application that uses the IMDB dataset to display all the films and shows that were released on today’s date in history.

        <span class="papers">User Interface Improvement Project </span>
        </br>
        </br>
        <p>In this project, I looked at a real world mobile app (Bracketor for Challonge), made prototype changes and ran qualitative and quantitative tests with real users.  These were the final revisions made to the prototype, not the entire project.  The prototype mockup was made using PowerPoint, where clicking different parts of the screen advanced you to different parts of the app. This file, however is in PDF format so the PowerPoint features that make the prototype work, won't work. This PDF will still give you a good idea what this user interface design project was about.

        </br>
        </br>
        <p>We made a full software project management plan for a fictional office appliances and décor company. Our plan was to develop a web based service tracking tool to schedule and keep track of the services and priorities of the company, with development divided into 6 sprints of 2 weeks.
